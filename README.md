Local Live is an app for focusing on the smaller and more intimate side of live music and events. There are plenty of apps that help promote today's stars. Those stars had to start somewhere and it was most likely at a bar or club just down the street. Local Live will help you find these smaller places that showcase local or midsize music events. We use the Songkick API for most of our information but in future versions will also feature user submitted events in hopes of giving the underground and truly homegrown music scenes a platform to get the word out about their work.
